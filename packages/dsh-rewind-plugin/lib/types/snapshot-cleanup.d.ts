/**
 * Snapshot cleanup policy: the settings-backed policy, its validation, the
 * `/snapshot-auto-cleanup` command's argument grammar, and the auto-sweep
 * throttle. Kept free of host wiring so the policy and the parser are
 * unit-testable in isolation; `src/index.ts` is the only consumer.
 *
 * Semantics (the "cleanup" vocabulary deliberately avoids "retention"):
 * - `enabled` toggles the AUTOMATIC (24h) sweep. `false` (the default) keeps
 *   every snapshot — the pre-feature behavior — and never persists a policy.
 * - `maxAgeDays` is the only "keep" knob: a finished session dir whose newest
 *   member stamp is older than this many days of idle is removed by a sweep.
 *   `0`/negative/non-integer are rejected, so a broken value can never steer
 *   the sweep into deleting everything.
 * - The policy lives in the dsh-settings document under
 *   `dsh-rewind-snapshot-cleanup`, created ONLY by an explicit
 *   `/snapshot-auto-cleanup` write. An absent value is the safe default (off);
 *   an unreadable or invalid value fail-closes a sweep (deletes nothing)
 *   instead of guessing.
