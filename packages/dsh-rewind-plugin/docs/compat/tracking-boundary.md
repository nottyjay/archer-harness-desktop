## One-line summary

Rewind **always** restores files edited with the dedicated editing tools
(`write` / `edit`) because the plugin snapshots them before the edit.
Command-line (or hand) edits are covered **only when the file was previously
registered** by an editing tool in the same conversation — and, in that case,
the change itself is recorded, but rewinding to a boundary inside an unchanged
interval is only as precise as the next recorded state (see
[Rewind precision](#rewind-precision-for-a-registered-file-changed-outside-editing-tools)).

## How file changes are classified

**Editing tools** (create/overwrite, line edits): each call tells the
plugin *which file* it will change, so the plugin snapshots the file's current
content **before** the edit and can restore it on rewind. This path is
deterministic — using them always yields a restorable rewind.

**Command-line or manual edits**: PowerShell (`pwsh`) writes on Windows, `sed -i`
on Linux, or saving a file by hand. These do **not** tell the plugin which file
is being touched, so there is nothing to snapshot beforehand.

Command/manual edits are nevertheless covered in one case: if the file was
**previously registered** by an editing tool in this conversation, the plugin
re-checks registered files at each user-message boundary and records a change it
sees, so those files restore on rewind too.

## When a rewind is not available

These are cases where there is **no recorded pre-change state at all** (as
opposed to the precision gap in the next section, where a state exists but an
intermediate message's exact value is lost):

1. **The model edits the file with a command on its first touch, and the file
   was never registered.** No snapshot, no registration — nothing was recorded
   around the change, so there is nothing to restore from. Every rewind target
   reports no restorable change for this file.
2. **The file was manually edited before the model's first editing-tool change.**
   The plugin's first snapshot is taken at the editing-tool call, so rewind can
   return the file only to its state *after* the manual edit, not before it.

Both stem from a deliberate **lightweight** trade-off. Supporting command edits
in every case would require scanning the whole workspace and classifying what
arbitrary commands changed — costly, error-prone, hard to maintain. Instead the
plugin registers only the editing tools that hand it an exact path, and relies
on the message-boundary re-check as its lightweight safety net. The cost is that
unregistered files' command edits are not recorded; the benefit is a simple,
reliable, maintainable plugin — the same behavior Claude Code exhibits.

## Rewind precision for a registered file changed outside editing tools

A registered file's snapshots come only from (a) an editing tool's before-capture
and (b) the boundary's change-detection. So a message is a *recording point* for
a file only when the file's state differs from its most recent recorded state;
rewinding to message *M* restores each file to the earliest entry at/after *M*.

If the file was **unchanged** at *M* (relative to its last record), then *M* is
**not** a recording point. If the file is later changed by a command/manual
edit, the earliest entry at/after *M* is the one that recorded the **post-change**
state — so rewinding to *M* restores that post-change state, not the state the
file actually held at *M*:

```
message 1   write sets f = "X"        records before=null (file created)
message 2   boundary records f = "X"  (null → X)
            a command changes f "X" → "Y"
message 3   boundary records f = "Y"  (X → Y)
rewind to message 2 → restores "X"    (correct: f was "X" at message 2)
```

Now insert one *unchanged* message, and the precision gap appears:

```
message 1   write sets f = "X"        records before=null (file created)
message 2   boundary records f = "X"  (null → X)
message 3   reply, f still "X"        NOT a recording point (unchanged)
            a command changes f "X" → "Y"
message 4   boundary records f = "Y"  (X → Y)
rewind to message 3 → restores "Y"    (wrong: f was "X" at message 3)
```

Message 2 is a recording point, so rewinding to it recovers the pre-change state
`X`; message 3 is not, so its exact state is lost once the command changes the
file. Only recording every registered file at every message — even when nothing
changed — would close this, at the cost of a per-message file per registered
file. The plugin avoids that to stay lightweight (see
[Position](#position)). Claude Code's checkpoints behave the same way.

## Position

Making command edits restorable in the *unregistered-first-touch* case would
mean repeatedly backing up the entire workspace, or depending on a Git working
tree — both heavy, and at odds with the plugin's lightweight-snapshot design.
Git is already the right tool for workspace-change management. The plugin's
position is to favor **fast, conversation-scoped rewinds**, so this capability
is deliberately not adopted.
